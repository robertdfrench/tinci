# tinci

*Minimal, Inexpensive CI Server*
Inspired by minimalist concepts from [Christopher Fred√©n's original work](https://github.com/icetan/tinci) and [Tomasz Maczukin's excellent Gitlab CI Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner).

## Goals

* [ ] Easy integration with GitHub
* [ ] Self-hosting
* [ ] Runs on AWS Lambda (nearly free when not in use)
* [ ] On-premises build agents (a la Gitlab CI Runner)
